This is a Flutter app. It takes an IRB-approved consent document in a special Markdown
format and presents in a Flutter app.

The **consent.md** document itself along with a **config.json** file are present
in the **assets** directory. The icons used for each section of the consent
document are specified in the **lib/iconMap.dart** dart file.

For a complete explanation of the app and its resources, please refer to the PDF
documentation in the **documentation** directory.
