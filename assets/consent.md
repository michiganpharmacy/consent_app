The Optimization of Medications in Chronic Heart Failure Using a Website: Welcome and thank you for your interest!

You are one of 100 patients participating in the use of this website. Complete participation of the study will be rewarded with a $25 gift card. In this study, we hope to determine if patient use of a website can improve drug regimens for patients with heart failure. You may benefit from this study by learning more about your heart failure drugs and by potentially improving your drug regimen.

Time Commitment: Completion of the study should only take 20-30 minutes.

Data Gathering:
summary: This website will collect some personal information about you, as well as certain information from your medical and prescription medication history.

Expand to see a full list of information that will be collected 

detail: The information that will be collected includes:

 - first name
 - last name
 - email address
 - age
 - gender
 - race
 - recent blood pressure reading
 - recent blood lab readings
 - recent heart rate reading
 - allergies
 - list of medications

Purpose: The website will make a recommendation about how to improve your medications or their doses. 

You may then share the medication recommendations with your medical provider via this website. Two weeks later, we will check your medical record for any changes to your medication list.

Participation: Your participation is voluntary. You don’t have to participate if you’d rather not. You may withdraw at any time without penalty, whatever the reason, and you don’t have to tell us why. 

Choosing not to participate won’t affect the medical care you might receive at the University of Michigan Health System.

A $25 gift card will be provided to participants that complete the website requirements AND send the medication recommendations to their medical provider through the website. 

Privacy:
summary: Your data will be de-identified once collected with only the study team having the ability to identify who participated in the study. Published results from this study will not include any personal information that would reveal who participated. 

Expand this section for more detailed information on data privacy and usage

detail: To keep your information confidential, we will label your collected information with a code, rather than your name or any other details that someone could use to identify you. Although we’ll keep a list of all the people who participate, no one outside our study team will be able to figure out who participated or which people received which results. We plan to publish what we learn from this study, but we won’t include any personal information that could reveal who participated.

With appropriate permissions, your collected information may also be shared with other researchers, here, around the world, and with companies.

Your identifiable private information may be stripped of identifiers and used for future research studies or distributed to another researcher for future research studies without additional informed consent.

Research can lead to new discoveries, such as new tests, drugs, or devices. Researchers, their organizations, and other entities, including companies, may potentially benefit from the use of the data or discoveries. You will not have rights to these discoveries or any proceeds from them.

Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability: This website is not for diagnosis or treatment of heart failure. You may benefit directly from this study if your drug regimen is improved through use of this website. However, it should not be used in place of the clinical judgment of a healthcare professional. We hope that what we learn will help other people in the future.

Release of Protected Health Information: 
summary: Agreeing to participate in this study gives the researchers your permission to obtain, use, and share information about you for this study, and is required for you to take part in this study. 

Your permission expires at the end of the study, unless you cancel it sooner. 

You may cancel your permission at any time by contacting the study team (information on next page)

Expand this section for more detailed information

detail: Information about you may be obtained from any hospital, doctor, and other health care provider involved in your care, including;

 - Hospital/doctor's office records, including test results (X-rays, blood tests, urine tests, etc.)
 - All records relating to your condition, the treatment you have received, and your response to the treatment
 - Demographic information
 - Personal identifiers

It is possible that the researchers or others will need access to information about you during or after this study. For example:

 - The researchers may need the information to make sure you can take part in the study.
 - The researchers may need the information to check your test results or look for side effects.
 - The University of Michigan or a government agency may need the information to make sure that the study is done in a safe and proper manner.
 - Study sponsors or funders, or safety monitors or committees, may
   need the information to make sure the study is done safely and
   properly, learn more about side effects, or analyze the results of the study.
 - The researchers may need to use the information to create a databank
   of information about your condition or its treatment.
 - Information about your study participation may be included in your
   regular UMHS medical record.
 - Federal or State law may require the study team to give information
   to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other government
   agencies. For example, to prevent harm to you or others, or for
   public health reasons.

The results of this study could be published in an article but would not include any information that would let others know who you are.

As a rule, the researchers will continue to use information about you until the study is over and will keep it secure until it is destroyed.

Limited information about you may continue to be used after the study is over, for other research, education, or other activities. But use of this information would not reveal your identity.

As long as your information is kept within the University of Michigan Health System, it is protected by the Health System’s privacy policies.

For more information see <http://www.med.umich.edu/hipaa/npp.htm>. Note that once your information has been shared with others, it may no longer be protected by the privacy regulations of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

A description of this clinical trial will be available on [www.ClinicalTrials.gov](http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov). This website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the website will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at any time.
